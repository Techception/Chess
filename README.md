mainly a SQL project for now.
creating the chess game in a sql table. 

main play table:
columns: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H
and 8 rows. 

so its very close to real chess at the moment.

I will represent the pieces like this:
white King - wK
white Queen - wQ
white Rook - wR
white Bishop - wB
white Knight - wN
white Pawn - wp

black King - bK
black Queen  - bQ
black Rook - bR
black Bishop - bB
black Knight - bN
black Pawn - bp
